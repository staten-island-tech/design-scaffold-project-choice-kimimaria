Model X made history when it became the first and only SUV to ever receive a
5-star safety rating in every category and sub-category from the U.S. National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Today, we’re excited to build on that
legacy with the addition of a 5-star safety rating from the European New Car
Assessment Programme Euro NCAP, which evaluates a car’s safety assistance
features as well as its ability to protect adults, children and vulnerable
road users.
