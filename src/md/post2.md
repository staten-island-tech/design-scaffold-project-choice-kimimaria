Like all Teslas, Model Y benefits from the same structural
architecture that make our other vehicles so safe energy-absorbing
side sills that act as side-impact crumple zones, a fortified battery
pack mounted low in the vehicle to reduce rollover risk and a metal
body structure that can withstand many times the carâ€™s weight.
